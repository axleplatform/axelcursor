        ELSE 'HAS PROFILE'
    END as profile_status
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON u.id = up.user_id
WHERE u.email IS NOT NULL OR u.phone IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY u.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 8. Final verification
SELECT 'Final verification:' as info;
SELECT

FROM users u
INNER JOIN user_profiles up ON u.id = up.user_id
WHERE u.email IS NOT NULL OR u.phone IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT

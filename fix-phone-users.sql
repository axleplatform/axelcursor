-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- 1. Show current situation with phone users
SELECT 'Current situation (including phone users):' as info;
SELECT 
    'auth.users with email' as table_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_count
FROM auth.users
WHERE email IS NOT NULL

    COUNT(*) as count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON u.id = up.user_id

-- 8. Show users that still need profiles (including phone users)
SELECT 'Users still needing profiles (including phone users):' as info;

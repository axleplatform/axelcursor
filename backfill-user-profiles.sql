-- 1. Backfill user_profiles for all existing auth.users
INSERT INTO user_profiles (

    phone,
    full_name,
    onboarding_completed,
    onboarding_type,

    u.created_at,
    u.updated_at
FROM auth.users u
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles up WHERE up.user_id = u.id
);

-- 2. Show the results
SELECT 
    'Total auth.users' as metric,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM auth.users
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Total user_profiles' as metric,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM user_profiles
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Users without profiles' as metric,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM auth.users u
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles up WHERE up.user_id = u.id
);

-- 3. Show some sample profiles created
SELECT 
    up.id,
    up.user_id,
    up.email,
    up.phone,

    up.created_at
FROM user_profiles up
ORDER BY up.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
